# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Intelligent Security system is designed to provide comprehensive, real-time security monitoring for modern campus environments. This system will leverage edge computing and cloud analytics to deliver intelligent threat detection, incident management, and evidence handling while maintaining strict privacy compliance with FERPA, GDPR, and COPPA regulations. The system targets mid-sized campuses (2-10k people) with 100-300 cameras and focuses on hybrid edge-cloud architecture for optimal performance, privacy, and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a campus security guard, I want to receive real-time alerts on my mobile device when security incidents are detected, so that I can respond quickly to potential threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident is detected by the AI system THEN the system SHALL send a mobile push notification to on-duty security personnel within 5 seconds
2. WHEN an alert is sent THEN the system SHALL include incident type, location, timestamp, and confidence level in the notification
3. WHEN multiple incidents occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize alerts based on threat severity and send them in order of importance
4. IF a guard acknowledges an alert THEN the system SHALL update the incident status and notify other relevant personnel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security supervisor, I want to view real-time security status and incident history through a web dashboard, so that I can monitor overall campus security and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a real-time map view showing all camera locations and their current status
2. WHEN an incident occurs THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard within 2 seconds with visual indicators
3. WHEN viewing incident history THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by date, location, incident type, and severity
4. IF evidence is available for an incident THEN the system SHALL provide secure access to video clips and metadata
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export incident data in standard formats (PDF, CSV) with proper redaction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a campus IT administrator, I want the system to operate with edge computing capabilities, so that we can minimize bandwidth usage and maintain privacy compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video streams THEN the system SHALL perform initial AI inference on edge devices without sending raw video to the cloud
2. WHEN edge devices detect incidents THEN the system SHALL only transmit metadata and relevant video clips to the central system
3. IF network connectivity is lost THEN edge devices SHALL continue operating independently and sync data when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN deploying edge updates THEN the system SHALL support remote firmware and model updates with rollback capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to maintain strict privacy controls and audit trails, so that we can meet FERPA, GDPR, and COPPA requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing video evidence THEN the system SHALL automatically redact faces and personally identifiable information by default
2. WHEN authorized personnel access evidence THEN the system SHALL log all access attempts with user identity, timestamp, and purpose
3. IF a data subject requests their information THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to locate and export their data within statutory timeframes
4. WHEN retaining data THEN the system SHALL automatically delete evidence according to configurable retention policies
5. WHEN handling sensitive areas THEN the system SHALL support zone-based privacy controls and access restrictions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to integrate with existing campus infrastructure, so that we can leverage current investments and maintain operational continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to cameras THEN the system SHALL support standard RTSP streams from existing IP cameras
2. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL integrate with campus SSO/SAML identity providers
3. IF existing VMS systems are present THEN the system SHALL provide API integration capabilities
4. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing communication systems (SMS, email, push notifications)
5. WHEN managing incidents THEN the system SHALL support integration with campus emergency response protocols

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to provide intelligent threat detection capabilities, so that we can identify security incidents accurately and reduce false positives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing video feeds THEN the system SHALL detect intrusion, loitering, crowding, and abandoned objects with configurable sensitivity
2. WHEN processing detections THEN the system SHALL achieve a false positive rate of ≤30% initially, improving to ≤10% after 3 months of operation
3. IF environmental conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt detection thresholds automatically based on time of day, weather, and historical patterns
4. WHEN multiple detection sources agree THEN the system SHALL increase confidence scores and prioritize alerts accordingly
5. WHEN new threat patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL support model retraining with labeled incident data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a campus facilities manager, I want the system to provide operational insights and analytics, so that I can optimize security coverage and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL provide heat maps showing incident frequency by location and time
2. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL identify trends in security incidents and suggest coverage improvements
3. IF camera performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators about maintenance needs or coverage gaps
4. WHEN reviewing system performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on detection accuracy, response times, and system uptime
5. WHEN planning security improvements THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations based on historical incident data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a campus emergency coordinator, I want the system to support emergency response procedures, so that we can coordinate effectively during critical incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high-severity incident is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate to emergency response protocols
2. WHEN emergency mode is activated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time location tracking and incident updates to response teams
3. IF multiple incidents occur during an emergency THEN the system SHALL coordinate response priorities and resource allocation
4. WHEN evidence is needed for investigations THEN the system SHALL provide secure, tamper-evident evidence export capabilities
5. WHEN emergency protocols change THEN the system SHALL support configurable escalation rules and notification chains

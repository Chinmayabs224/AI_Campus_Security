# Compliance and Data Protection Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive compliance and data protection implementation for the campus security system, covering GDPR, FERPA, COPPA, and other privacy regulations.

## Overview

The compliance implementation consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Retention Service** - Manages data lifecycle and automated deletion
2. **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Service** - Conducts privacy risk assessments
3. **Policy Enforcement Engine** - Automated policy monitoring and enforcement
4. **Compliance Monitor** - Framework-specific compliance checking
5. **Backup and Recovery Manager** - Disaster recovery and business continuity
